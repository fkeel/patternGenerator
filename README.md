# Physical Interpolation by Interdigitation - Making More Precise eTextiles

This is an exploration of patterns that can be used to improve the sensing precision of resistive textile matrix sensors

## Getting Started

Get the most recent version of Processing at processing.org. Extract all the .pde files in a folder called patternGenerator
Double-click any one and then hit 'run' in the processing IDE



## Acknowledgments

This project is a potential expansion to Maurin Donneaud's resistive eTextile matrix
